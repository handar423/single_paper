\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents \sysname, a FaaS scheduler designed to address the resource utilization challenges caused by heterogeneous function resource demands. First, \sysname co-locates functions at the cluster-level with complementary swarming instance placement strategy, which not only improves overall server utilization but also increases instance-reuse opportunities by narrowing the function serving set per server. Second, with monotonic scale-up task scheduling, \sysname aligns task processing ordering with the in-place scaling capability of Kubernetes pods. This allows pod resource allocation to be dynamically adjusted according to actual task demands, effectively reducing cold starts without over-provisioning. As demonstrated in the evaluation, \sysname shows significant improvements over the baselines in both resource efficiency and task throughput, while adding negligible system overhead and maintaining scalable performance. Flexible, fine-grained resource configuration is becoming a prevailing trend in modern FaaS platforms, which presents both new challenges and opportunities for scheduling. We hope that our design can serve as a reference and inspire further research in this direction.
