\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents \sysname, a serverless computing system designed to address the resource utilization challenges caused by heterogeneous function resource demands. First, \sysname co-locates functions at the cluster level with complementary swarming request routing, which not only improves overall server utilization but also increases instance reuse opportunities by narrowing the function serving set per node. Second, with monotonic scale-up scheduling, \sysname aligns request processing ordering with the in-place scaling capability of Kubernetes pods. This allows instance resource allocation to be dynamically adjusted according to actual request demands, effectively reducing cold starts without over-provisioning. As demonstrated in the evaluation, \sysname shows significant improvements over the baselines in both resource utilization and task throughput, while adding negligible system overhead and maintaining scalable performance.
